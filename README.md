# Manage_landing_page

I come with one more challenge from Frontend Mentor. For this project, it was necessary to create a carousel and change the order of the elements and also the background images.
I created the carousel using only HTML and CSS. Javascript was used to make the carousel become automatic.
Another interesting part of this project was the use of the display flex to change the order of the elements according to the size of the screen (mobile, laptop or desktop).
It was a very interesting project and I thank Frontend Mentor for giving us this opportunity.
